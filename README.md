# Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research: Workflow Automation for Neuro-oncology (I3CR-WANO)
This project aims to offer a completely automated and end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-driven workflow for curation and preprocessing of large-scale MRI neuro-oncology studies, with subsequent extraction of quantitative phenotypes.

**Note** that, this is Repository 2/2 of a two-part repository. All usage instructions of this repo can be found at Repository 1/2 at [NRG_AI_NeuroOnco_preproc](https://github.com/satrajitgithub/NRG_AI_NeuroOnco_preproc)

This project is created by the Neuroinformatics Research Group ([NRG](https://nrg.wustl.edu/)) at the Computational Imaging Research Center (Washington University School of Medicine).
